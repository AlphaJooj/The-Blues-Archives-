                <b>John Lee Hooker</b> (August 22, 1912 or 1917 – June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer,
                songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric
                guitar-style adaptation of Delta blues. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking
                blues and early North Mississippi Hill country blues. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style,
                distinct from the 1930s–1940s piano-derived boogie-woogie. Hooker was ranked 35 in Rolling Stone's 2015
                list of 100 greatest guitarists.<br><br>
                Some of his best known songs include "Boogie Chillen'" (1948), "Crawling King Snake" (1949), "Dimples"
                (1956), "Boom Boom" (1962), and "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer" (1966). Several of his later albums,
                including The Healer (1989), Mr. Lucky (1991), Chill Out (1995), and Don't Look Back (1997), were album
                chart successes in the U.S. and UK. The Healer (for the song "I'm In The Mood") and Chill Out (for the
                album) both earned him Grammy wins as well as Don't Look Back, which went on to earn him a
                double-Grammy win for Best Traditional Blues Recording and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (with Van
                Morrison).

        <h2 class="pt-3">Early Life</h2>
        <p class="summary-text">
            Hooker's date of birth is a subject of debate; the years 1912, 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have all been
            suggested. Most official sources list 1917, though at times Hooker stated he was born in 1920. Information
            found in the 1920 and 1930 censuses indicates that he was actually born in 1912. In 2017, a series of
            events took place to celebrate the purported centenary of his birth. In the 1920 federal census, John
            Hooker is seven years old and one of nine children living with William and Minnie Hooker in Tutwiler,
            Mississippi. <br><br>
            It is believed that he was born in Tutwiler, in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his
            birthplace was near Clarksdale, in Coahoma County. He was the youngest of the 11 children of William
            Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923), a sharecropper and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c.
            1880, date of death unknown). In the 1920 federal census, William and Minnie were recorded as being 48
            and 39 years old, respectively, which implies that Minnie was born about 1880, not 1875. She was said to
            have been a "decade or so younger" than her husband (Boogie Man, p. 23), which gives additional credibility
            to this census record as evidence of Hooker's origins.<br><br>
            The Hooker children were homeschooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the
            spirituals sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The
            next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an
            introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).<br><br>
            Moore was his first significant blues influence. He was a local blues guitarist who, in Shreveport,
            Louisiana, learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the Delta blues of
            the time.<br><br>
            Another influence was Tony Hollins, who dated Hooker's sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave
            him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his
            style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were
            versions of "Crawlin' King Snake" and "Catfish Blues".<br><br>
            At the age of 14, Hooker ran away from home, reportedly never seeing his mother or stepfather again. In
            the mid-1930s, he lived in Memphis, Tennessee, where he performed on Beale Street, at the New Daisy Theatre
            and occasionally at house parties.<br><br>
            He worked in factories in various cities during World War II, eventually getting a job with the Ford Motor
            Company in Detroit in 1943. He frequented the blues clubs and bars on Hastings Street, the heart of the
            black entertainment district, on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were
            scarce. Hooker's popularity grew quickly as he performed in Detroit clubs, and, seeking an instrument louder
            than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.

        <h2 class="pt-3">Early Career</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-7 summary-text">
                Hooker was working as janitor in a Detroit steel mill when his recording career began in 1948, when
                Modern Records, based in Los Angeles, released a demo he had recorded for Bernie Besman in Detroit.
                The single, "Boogie Chillen'", became a hit and the best-selling race record of 1949. Though
                illiterate, Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting traditional blues lyrics, he
                composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record
                sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To
                evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for Chess Records
                and Chance Records in 1951–1952), Johnny Lee (for De Luxe Records in 1953–1954), John Lee, John Lee
                Cooker, Texas Slim, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar, Johnny Williams, and the Boogie
                Man.<br><br>
                His early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman. Hooker rarely played with a standard beat, but
                instead he changed tempo to fit the needs of the song. This often made it difficult to use backing
                musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker
                playing guitar, singing and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.<br><br>
                For much of this period he recorded and toured with Eddie Kirkland. In Hooker's later sessions for
                Vee-Jay Records in Chicago, studio musicians accompanied him on most of his recordings, including Eddie
                Taylor, who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies. "Boom Boom" (1962) and "Dimples", two popular songs
                by Hooker, were originally released by Vee-Jay.

        <h2 class="pt-3">Later Career</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-7 summary-text">
                Beginning in 1962, Hooker gained greater exposure when he toured Europe in the annual American Folk
                Blues
                Festival. His "Dimples" became a successful single on the UK Singles Charts in 1964, eight years after
                its first US release. Hooker began to perform and record with rock musicians. One of his earliest
                collaborations was with British blues rock band the Groundhogs. In 1970, he recorded the joint album
                Hooker 'n Heat, with the American blues and boogie rock group Canned Heat, whose repertoire included
                adaptations of Hooker songs. It became the first of Hooker's albums to reach the Billboard charts,
                peaking at number 78 on the Billboard 200. Other collaboration albums soon followed, including Endless
                Boogie (1971) and Never Get Out of These Blues Alive (1972), which included Steve Miller, Elvin Bishop,
                Van
                Morrison, and others.<br><br>
                Hooker appeared in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. He performed "Boom Boom" in the role of a street
                musician. In 1989, he recorded the album The Healer with Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt, and others. The
                1990s
                saw additional collaboration albums: Mr. Lucky (1991), Chill Out (1995), and Don't Look Back (1997) with
                Morrison, Santana, Los Lobos, and additional guest musicians. His re-recording of "Boom Boom" (the title
                track for his 1992 album) with guitarist Jimmie Vaughan became Hooker's highest charting single (number
                16)
                in the UK. Come See About Me, a 2004 DVD, includes performances filmed between 1960 and 1994 and
                interviews with several of the musicians.<br><br>
                Hooker owned five houses in his later life, including houses located in Los Altos, California; Redwood
                City,
                California, Long Beach, California, and Gilroy, California.
