                <b>Riley B. King</b> (September 16, 1925 – May 14, 2015), known professionally as B.B. King, was an American
                blues singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. He introduced a sophisticated style of soloing
                based on fluid string bending, shimmering vibrato and staccato picking that influenced many later blues
                electric guitar players. AllMusic recognized King as "the single most important electric guitarist
                of the last half of the 20th century".<br><br>
                King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and is one of the most influential blues
                musicians of all time, earning the nickname "The King of the Blues", and is considered one of the "Three
                Kings of the Blues Guitar" (along with Albert King and Freddie King, none of whom are related).
                King performed tirelessly throughout his musical career, appearing on average at more than 200 concerts
                per year into his 70s. In 1956 alone, he appeared at 342 shows.<br><br>
                King was born on a cotton plantation in Itta Bena, Mississippi, and later worked at a cotton gin in
                Indianola, Mississippi. He was attracted to music and the guitar in church, and he began his career in
                juke joints and local radio. He later lived in Memphis and Chicago; then, as his fame grew, toured the
                world extensively. King died at the age of 89 in Las Vegas on May 14, 2015.

        <h2 class="pt-3">Early Life</h2>
        <p class="summary-text">
            Riley B. King was born on September 16, 1925, on the Berclair cotton plantation near the city of Itta
            Bena, Mississippi, the son of sharecroppers Albert and Nora Ella King. He considered the nearby
            city of Indianola, Mississippi, to be his home. When King was four years old, his mother left his father
            for another man, so he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Elnora Farr, in Kilmichael,
            Mississippi.<br><br>
            While young, King sang in the gospel choir at Elkhorn Baptist Church in Kilmichael. King was attracted to
            the Pentecostal Church of God in Christ because of its music. The local minister performed with a Sears
            Roebuck Silvertone guitar during services, and taught King his first three chords. King's first guitar
            was bought for him by Mr. Flake Cartledge, his employer in Kilmichael, for 15 dollars. Cartledge withheld
            money from King's salary for the next two months until the debt was repaid.

            <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-7 summary-text">
                In November 1941, King Biscuit Time first aired, broadcasting on KFFA in Helena, Arkansas. It was a
                radio show featuring the Mississippi Delta blues. King listened to it while on break at a plantation. A
                self-taught guitarist, he then wanted to become a radio musician.<br><br>
                In 1943, King left Kilmichael to work as a tractor driver and play guitar with the Famous St. John's
                Gospel Singers of Inverness, Mississippi, performing at area churches and on WGRM in Greenwood,
                Mississippi.<br><br>
                In 1946, King followed Bukka White to Memphis, Tennessee. White took him in for the next ten months.[13]
                However, King returned to Mississippi shortly afterward, where he decided to prepare himself better for
                the next visit, and returned to West Memphis, Arkansas, two years later in 1948. He performed on Sonny
                Boy Williamson's radio program on KWEM in West Memphis, where he began to develop an audience. King's
                appearances led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis, and later to a
                ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. The radio spot became so popular that it was expanded
                and became the Sepia Swing Club.<br><br>
                He worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, where he was given the nickname "Beale Street Blues Boy",
                later shortened to "Blues Boy", and finally to B.B. It was there that he first met T-Bone
                Walker. King said, "Once I'd heard him for the first time, I knew I'd have to have [an electric guitar]
                myself. 'Had' to have one, short of stealing!"

        <h1 class="pt-3">Career</h1>
        <h2 class="">1949–2005</h2>
        <p class="summary-text">
            In the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. "Beale Street was
            where it all started for me," King said. He performed with Bobby Bland, Johnny Ace and Earl Forest in a
            group known as the Beale Streeters.<br><br>
            According to King and Joe Bihari, Ike Turner introduced King to the Bihari brothers while he was a talent
            scout at Modern Records. In 1949, King began recording songs under contract with Los Angeles-based
            RPM Records, a subsidiary of Modern. Many of King's early recordings were produced by Sam Phillips, who
            later founded Sun Records. Before his RPM contract, King had debuted on Bullet Records by issuing the
            single, "Miss Martha King" (1949), which did not chart well. "My very first recordings [in 1949] were
            for a company out of Nashville called Bullet, the Bullet Record Transcription company," King recalled. "I
            had horns that very first session. I had Phineas Newborn on piano; his father played drums, and his brother,
            Calvin, played guitar with me. I had Tuff Green on bass, Ben Branch on tenor sax, his brother, Thomas, on
            trumpet, and a lady trombone player. The Newborn family were the house band at the famous Plantation Inn in
            West Memphis."

        <div class="row">
            <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-7 summary-text">
                King assembled his own band; the B.B. King Review, under the leadership of Millard Lee. The band
                initially consisted of Calvin Owens and Kenneth Sands (trumpet), Lawrence Burdin (alto saxophone),
                George Coleman (tenor saxophone), Floyd Newman (baritone saxophone), Millard Lee (piano), George
                Joyner (bass) and Earl Forest and Ted Curry (drums). Onzie Horne was a trained musician enlisted as an
                arranger to assist King with his compositions. By his own admission, King could not play chords well and
                always relied on improvisation.<br><br>
                King's recording contract was followed by tours across the United States, with performances in major
                theatres in cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, and St. Louis, as well as
                numerous gigs in small clubs and juke joints of the southern United States. During one show in Twist,
                Arkansas, a brawl broke out between two men and caused a fire. He evacuated along with the rest of the
                crowd but went back to retrieve his guitar. He said he later found out that the two men were fighting
                over a woman named Lucille. He named the guitar Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run
                into any more burning buildings.

        <p class="summary-text">
            Following his first Billboard Rhythm and Blues charted number one, "3 O'Clock Blues" (February
            1952), B.B. King became one of the most important names in R&B music in the 1950s, amassing an
            impressive list of hits including "You Know I Love You", "Woke Up This Morning", "Please Love Me",
            "When My Heart Beats like a Hammer", "Whole Lotta Love", "You Upset Me Baby", "Every Day I Have the
            Blues", "Sneakin' Around", "Ten Long Years", "Bad Luck", "Sweet Little Angel", "On My Word of Honor",
            and "Please Accept My Love". This led to a significant increase in his weekly earnings, from about $85
            to $2,500, with appearances at major venues such as the Howard Theater in Washington and the
            Apollo in New York, as well as touring the "Chitlin' Circuit". 1956 became a record-breaking year, with
            342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label,
            Blues Boys Kingdom, with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. There, among other projects, he was a
            producer for artists such as Millard Lee and Levi Seabury. In 1962, King signed to ABC-Paramount
            Records, which was later absorbed into MCA Records (which itself was later absorbed into Geffen
            Records). In November 1964, King recorded the Live at the Regal album at the Regal Theater. King
            later said that Regal Live "is considered by some the best recording I've ever had ... that particular
            day in Chicago everything came together".<br><br>
            From the late 1960s, new manager Sid Seidenberg pushed King into a different type of venue as blues-rock
            performers like Eric Clapton (once a member of The Yardbirds, as well as Cream) and Paul Butterfield were
            popularizing an appreciation of blues music among white audiences. King gained further visibility among
            rock audiences as an opening act on the Rolling Stones' 1969 American Tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award
            for his version of the song "The Thrill Is Gone;" which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It
            also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

            <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-7 summary-text">
                King was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and the
                National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2014. In 2004, he was awarded the international Polar
                Music Prize, given to artists "in recognition of exceptional achievements in the creation and
                advancement of music".<br><br>
                From the 1980s to his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on
                numerous television shows and sometimes performing 300 nights a year. In 1988, King reached a new
                generation of fans with the single "When Love Comes to Town", a collaborative effort between King and
                the Irish band U2 on their Rattle and Hum album. In December 1997, he performed in the Vatican's
                fifth annual Christmas concert and presented his trademark guitar "Lucille" to Pope John Paul
                II. In 1998, he appeared in The Blues Brothers 2000, playing the part of the lead singer of the
                Louisiana Gator Boys, along with Eric Clapton, Dr. John, Koko Taylor and Bo Diddley. In 2000, he and
                Clapton teamed up again to record Riding With the King, which won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional
                Blues Album.<br><br>
                Discussing where he took the Blues, from "dirt floor, smoke in the air" joints to grand concert halls,
                King said the Blues belonged everywhere beautiful music belonged. He successfully worked both sides of
                the commercial divide, with sophisticated recordings and "raw, raucous" live performance.

        <p class="summary-text">
            In 2006, King went on a "farewell" world tour, although he remained active afterward. The tour was
            partly supported by Northern Irish guitarist, Gary Moore, with whom King had previously toured and recorded.
            It started in the United Kingdom, and continued with performances at the Montreux Jazz Festival and in
            Zürich at the Blues at Sunset. During his show in Montreux at the Stravinski Hall, he jammed with Joe
            Sample, Randy Crawford, David Sanborn, Gladys Knight, Leela James, Andre Beeka, Earl Thomas, Stanley Clarke,
            John McLaughlin, Barbara Hendricks and George Duke.<br><br>
            In June 2006, King was present at a memorial of his first radio broadcast at the Three Deuces Building in
            Greenwood, Mississippi, where an official marker of the Mississippi Blues Trail was erected. The same month,
            a groundbreaking was held for a new museum, dedicated to King, in Indianola, Mississippi. The B.B.
            King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center opened on September 13, 2008.<br><br>
            In late October 2006, King recorded a concert album and video entitled B.B. King: Live at his B.B. King
            Blues Clubs in Nashville and Memphis. The video of the four-night production featured his regular B.B. King
            Blues Band and captured his show as he performed it nightly around the world. Released in 2008, they
            documented his first live performances in over a decade.

                In 2007, King played at Eric Clapton's second Crossroads Guitar Festival and contributed the songs
                "Goin' Home", to Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino (with Ivan Neville's DumpstaPhunk) and "One
                Shoe Blues" to Sandra Boynton's children's album Blue Moo, accompanied by a pair of sock puppets in a
                music video for the song. In the summer of 2008, King played at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in
                Manchester, Tennessee,
                where he was given a key to the city. Also in 2008, he was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of
                Fame.<br><br>
                King performed at the Mawazine festival in Rabat, Morocco on May 27, 2010. In June 2010, King
                performed at the Crossroads Guitar Festival with Robert Cray, Jimmie Vaughan, and Eric Clapton. He also
                contributed to Cyndi Lauper's album Memphis Blues, which was released on June 22, 2010.

                and Blues," during which President Barack Obama sang part of "Sweet Home Chicago". King recorded for the
                debut album of rapper and producer Big K.R.I.T., who also hails from Mississippi. On July 5, 2012, King
                performed a concert at the Byblos International Festival in Lebanon.<br><br>
                On October 3, 2014, after completing his live performance at the House of Blues in Chicago, a doctor
                diagnosed King with dehydration and exhaustion, and the eight remaining shows of his ongoing tour had to
                be cancelled. King did not reschedule the shows, and the House of Blues show would prove to be the last
                before his death in 2015.
