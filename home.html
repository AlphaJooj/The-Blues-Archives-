      Blues is a music genre and musical form born in the deep south of the United States, more notably in the
      Mississipi Delta, around the 1860s by African-Americans.
      Back then, slavery was still existed and the people resorted to music to help ease the burden of the hard labour
      in the cotton fields. The origins of the blues are closely related to the religious music of Afro-American
      community, the spirituals. The origins of spirituals go back much further than the blues, usually dating back to
      the middle of the 18th century, when the slaves were Christianized and began to sing and play Christian hymns,
      which were very popular. Before the blues gained its formal definition in
      terms of chord progressions, it was defined as the secular counterpart of spirituals. It was the low-down music
      played by rural blacks. Depending on the religious community a musician belonged to, it was more or less
      considered a sin to play this low-down music: blues was the devil's music. Musicians were therefore segregated
      into two categories: gospel singers and blues singers.
