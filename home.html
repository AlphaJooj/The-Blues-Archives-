      <h4>Origins</h4>
      <p class="col-lg-9 col-sm-12 summary-text">
        Blues is a music genre and musical form born in the deep south of the United States, more notably in the
        Mississipi Delta, around the 1860s by African-Americans.
        Back then, slavery was still existed and the people resorted to music to help ease the burden of the hard labour
        in the cotton fields.<br><br>The origins of the blues are closely related to the religious music of
        Afro-American
        community, the spirituals. The origins of spirituals go back much further than the blues, usually dating back to
        the middle of the 18th century, when the slaves were Christianized and began to sing and play Christian hymns,
        which were very popular. Before the blues gained its formal definition in
        terms of chord progressions, it was defined as the secular counterpart of spirituals. It was the low-down music
        played by rural blacks.<br><br>Depending on the religious community a musician belonged to, it was more or less
        considered a sin to play this low-down music: blues was the devil's music. Musicians were therefore segregated
        into two categories: gospel singers and blues singers. Musicians were therefore segregated into two categories:
        gospel singers and blues singers, guitar preachers and songsters. However, when rural black music began to be
        recorded in the 1920s, both categories of musicians used similar techniques: call-and-response patterns, blue
        notes, and slide guitars. Gospel music was nevertheless using musical forms that were compatible with Christian
        hymns and therefore, less marked by the blues form than its secular counterpart.

      <h4>Early Artists</h4>
      <p class="col-lg-9 col-sm-12 summary-text">
        By the time of the 1920s, the blues became a major element of the american popular music, also reaching the
        withe
        audience
        via the classic female blues performers like Bessie Smith. These female performers became perhaps the first
        African American "superstars", and their recording sales demonstrated "a huge appetite for records made by and
        for
        black people".<br><br> As the recording industry grew, names like Blind Lemon Jefferson, Lonnie Johnson and
        Blind Blake
        became more popular in the African American community. The first blues recordings from the 1920s are categorized
        as a traditional, rural country blues and a more polished city or urban blues. Country blues performers often
        improvised, either without accompaniment or with only a banjo or guitar. City or urban blues styles were more
        codified and elaborate, as a performer was no longer within their local, immediate community, and had to adapt
        to
        a larger, more varied audience's aesthetic. Another notable name was Robert Johnson, who after being
        rediscovered years after his death, is now recognized as a master of the particular Delta Blues style.

      <h4>The Blues in The 1950s</h4>
      <p class="col-lg-9 col-sm-12 summary-text">
        In a movement known as the Great Migration, many rural blacks moved to urban areas like Chicago, Detroit and St.
        Louis, and
        the new migrants constituted a new market for the music industry. The term race record, initially used by the
        music industry for African-American music, was replaced by the term rhythm and blues (R&B). This commercial
        stream
        had important consequences for blues music, which, together with jazz and gospel music, became a component of
        R&B.<br><br>
        After World War II, new styles of electric blues became popular in cities such as Chicago, Memphis, Detroit and
        St. Louis
        and Chicago became a center for electric blues from 1948 on, when Muddy Waters recorded his first success, "I
        Can't Be Satisfied". Chicago blues is influenced to a large extent by the Delta blues, because many performers
        had
        migrated from the Mississippi region to Chicago. Other notable names from that time are Willie Dixon, Howlin'
        Wolf
        and John Lee Hooker.

      <h4>1960s and 1970s</h4>
      <p class="col-lg-9 col-sm-12 summary-text">
        By the beginning of the 1960s, genres like rock and roll and soul were the mainstream popular music. Bands like
        the Rolling Stones and Beatles had brought African-American music to new audiences, not only in the United
        States, but all around the world.
        However, the blues wave that brought artists such as Muddy Waters to the foreground had stopped.<br><br>
        Blues performers such as John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters continued to perform to enthusiastic audiences,
        inspiring new artists to steepe in traditional blues, such as New Yorkâ€“born Taj Mahal. John Lee Hooker blended
        his
        blues style with rock elements and by playing with younger white musicians, created a musical style that can be
        heard on the 1971 album "Endless Boogie".<br><br> By this
        time B.
        B. King's
        singing and virtuoso guitar technique earned him the eponymous title "king of the blues". During this period,
        Freddie King and Albert King often played with rock and soul musicians (Eric Clapton and Booker T & the MGs) and
        had a major influence on those styles of music.<br><br> In the early 1970s, the Texas rock-blues style emerged,
        which
        used
        guitars in both solo and rhythm roles. Major artists of the Texas style are Johnny Winter, Stevie Ray Vaughan,
        the
        Fabulous Thunderbirds (led by harmonica player and singer-songwriter Kim Wilson), and ZZ Top.

      <h4>1980s to Present Day</h4>
      <p class="col-lg-9 col-sm-12 summary-text">
        During the 1980s blues also continued in both traditional and new forms. The first Stevie Ray Vaughan recording
        "Texas Flood" was released in 1983, and the Texas-based guitarist exploded onto the international stage. John
        Lee
        Hooker's popularity was revived with the album "The Healer" in 1989. Eric Clapton made a comeback in the 1990s
        with his album "Unplugged", in which he played some standard blues numbers on acoustic guitar.<br><br>
        In the 1990s, the largely ignored hill country blues gained minor recognition in both blues and alternative rock
        music circles with northern Mississippi artists R. L. Burnside and Junior Kimbrough. Contemporary blues music is
        nurtured by several blues labels such as: Fat Possum Records and Ruf Records. Some labels are famous for
        rediscovering and remastering blues rarities, including Arhoolie Records and Yazoo Records (Shanachie Records).
