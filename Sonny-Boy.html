            <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-8 summary-text">
                Alex or Aleck Miller, known later in his career as Sonny Boy Williamson, was an American blues harmonica
                player, singer and songwriter.
                He was an early and influential blues harp stylist who recorded successfully in the 1950s and 1960s.
                Miller used various names, including Rice Miller and Little Boy Blue, before calling himself Sonny Boy
                Williamson, which was also the name of a popular Chicago blues singer and harmonica player. To
                distinguish the two, Miller has been referred to as Sonny Boy Williamson II.<br><br>
                He first recorded with Elmore James on "Dust My Broom". Some of his popular songs include "Don't
                Start Me Talkin'", "Help Me", "Checkin' Up on My Baby", and "Bring It On Home". He toured Europe with
                the American Folk Blues Festival and recorded with English rock musicians, including the Yardbirds, the
                Animals. "Help Me" became a blues standard, and many blues and rock artists have recorded his songs.

        <h2 class="pt-3">Early Days</h2>
        <p class="summary-text">
            Miller's date and place of birth are disputed. There are various opinions about his year of birth, five of
            which are 1897, 1899, 1907, 1909, and 1912. According to David Evans, professor of music and an
            ethnomusicologist at the University of Memphis, census records indicate that Miller was born in about 1912,
            being seven years old on February 2, 1920, the day of the census. Miller's gravestone at Tutwiler,
            Mississippi, set up by record company owner Lillian McMurry twelve years after his death, gives his date of
            birth as March 11, 1908. In a spoken word performance called “The Story of Sonny Boy Williamson” that
            was later included in several compilations, Miller states that he was born in Glendora, Mississippi in 1897.
            According to researchers Bob Eagle and Eric S. LeBlanc, he was born in the small community of Money, near
            Greenwood, Mississippi, in 1912.

                He lived and worked with his sharecropper stepfather, Jim Miller, whose last name he soon adopted, and
                mother, Millie Ford, until the early 1930s. Beginning in the 1930s, he traveled around Mississippi and
                Arkansas and encountered Big Joe Williams, Elmore James and Robert Lockwood Jr., also known as Robert
                Junior Lockwood, who would play guitar on his later Checker Records sides. He was also associated with
                Robert Johnson during this period. Miller developed his style and raffish stage persona during these
                years. Willie Dixon recalled seeing Lockwood and Miller playing for tips in Greenville, Mississippi, in
                the 1930s. He entertained audiences with novelties such as inserting one end of the harmonica into his
                mouth and playing with no hands. At this time he was often known as "Rice" Miller—a childhood nickname
                stemming from his love of rice and milk—or as "Little Boy Blue".<br><br>
                In 1941 Miller was hired to play the King Biscuit Time show, advertising the King Biscuit brand of
                baking flour on radio station KFFA in Helena, Arkansas, with Lockwood. The program's sponsor, Max Moore,
                began billing Miller as Sonny Boy Williamson, apparently in an attempt to capitalize on the fame of the
                well-known Chicago-based harmonica player and singer Sonny Boy Williamson (birth name John Lee Curtis
                Williamson, died 1948). Although John Lee Williamson was a major blues star who had already released
                dozens of successful and widely influential records under the name "Sonny Boy Williamson" from 1937
                onward, Miller would later claim to have been the first to use the name. Some blues scholars believe
                that Miller's assertion he was born in 1899 was a ruse to convince audiences he was old enough to have
                used the name before John Lee Williamson, who was born in 1914.

        <h2 class="pt-3">Radio show in West Memphis</h2>
        <p class="summary-text">
            In 1949, Williamson relocated to West Memphis, Arkansas, and lived with Howlin' Wolf. (Later, for Checker
            Records, he did a parody of Howlin' Wolf, entitled "Like Wolf".) He started his own KWEM radio show from
            1948 to 1950, selling the elixir Hadacol. He brought his King Biscuit musician friends to West
            Memphis—Elmore James, Houston Stackhouse, Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup, Robert Nighthawk and others—to perform on
            KWEM radio. Williamson married Howlin' Wolf's half-sister Mae and he showed Wolf how to play harmonica.

        <h2 class="pt-3">Recording Career</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-8 summary-text">
                Williamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for Lillian McMurry of Trumpet Records, based in
                Jackson, Mississippi. It was three years since the death of John Lee Williamson, which for the first
                time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being "the one and only Sonny Boy
                Williamson". When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955, Williamson's recording contract was yielded to its
                creditors, who sold it to Chess Records in Chicago. He had begun developing a following in Chicago
                beginning in 1953, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James's band. During his Chess years he
                enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim, recording about 70 songs for the Chess subsidiary Checker
                Records from 1955 to 1964. His first LP record was a compilation of previously released singles. Titled
                Down and Out Blues, Checker released the collection in 1959. A single, "Boppin' with Sonny" backed with
                "No Nights by Myself", was released by Ace Records in 1955.<br><br>
                In 1972, Chess released This Is My Story, a compilation album featuring Williamson's recordings for the
                label. It was later included in Robert Christgau's "basic record library" of 1950s and 1960s recordings,
                published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981).

        <h2 class="pt-3">1960s European tours</h2>
        <p class="summary-text">
            In the early 1960s he toured Europe several times during the height of the British blues craze, backed on a
            number of occasions by the Authentics (see American Folk Blues Festival), recording with the Yardbirds (for
            the album Sonny Boy Williamson and the Yardbirds) and the Animals, and appearing on several television
            broadcasts throughout Europe. Around this time he was quoted as saying of the backing bands who accompanied
            him, "those British boys want to play the blues real bad, and they do". Led Zeppelin biographer Stephen
            Davis writes in Hammer of the Gods, while in England Williamson set his hotel room on fire while trying to
            cook a rabbit in a coffee percolator. The book also maintains that future Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant
            stole one of the bluesman's harmonicas at one of these shows.<br><br>
            Sonny Boy took a liking to the European fans, and while there had a custom-made, two-tone suit tailored
            personally for him, along with a bowler hat, matching umbrella, and an attaché case for his harmonicas. He
            appears credited as "Big Skol" on Roland Kirk's live album Kirk in Copenhagen (1963).

        <h2 class="pt-3">Death</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-8 summary-text">
                Upon his return to the U.S., he resumed playing the King Biscuit Time show on KFFA, and performed in the
                Helena, Arkansas area. As fellow musicians Houston Stackhouse and Peck Curtis waited at the KFFA studios
                for Williamson on May 25, 1965, the 12:15 broadcast time was approaching and Williamson was nowhere in
                sight. Peck left the radio station to locate Williamson, and discovered his body in bed at the rooming
                house where he had been staying, dead of an apparent heart attack suffered in his sleep the night
                before. Williamson is buried on New Africa Road, just outside Tutwiler, Mississippi at the site of the
                former Whitman Chapel cemetery. Trumpet Records owner McMurry provided the headstone with an incorrect
                date of death.
