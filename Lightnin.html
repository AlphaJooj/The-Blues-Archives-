      <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-8 summary-text"><b>Samuel John "Lightnin" Hopkins</b> (March 15, 1912 - January 30,
        1982) was an
        American
        country blues singer, songwriter, guitarist and occasional pianist from Centerville, Texas. In 2010, <i>Rolling
          Stone</i> magazine ranked him No. 71 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.<br><br>
        The musicologist Robert "Mack" McCormick opined that Hopkins is "the embodiment of the jazz-and-poetry spirit,
        representing its ancient form in the single creator whose words and music are one act".
        He was a notable influence on Townes Van Zandt, Hank Williams, Jr., and a generation of blues musicians like
        Stevie Ray Vaughan, whose Grammy winning song "Rude Mood" was directly inspired by the Texan's song "Hopkins'
        Sky Hop."</p>

    <h2 class="pt-3">Life</h2>
    <p class="summary-text">Hopkins was born in Centerville, Texas. As a child, he was immersed in the sounds of the
      blues. He
      developed a deep appreciation for the music at the age of 8, when he met Blind Lemon Jefferson at a church picnic
      in Buffalo, Texas. He went on to learn from his distant older cousin, the country blues singer Alger "Texas"
      Alexander; Hopkins had another cousin, the Texas electric blues guitarist Frankie Lee Sims, with whom he later
      recorded. Hopkins began accompanying Jefferson on guitar at informal church gatherings. Jefferson reputedly
      never let anyone play with him except Hopkins, and Hopkins learned much from Jefferson at these
      gatherings.<br><br>
      In the mid-1930s, Hopkins was sent to Houston County Prison Farm, but the offence for which he was imprisoned is
      unknown. In the late 1930s, he moved to Houston with Alexander in an unsuccessful attempt to break into the
      music scene there. By the early 1940s, he was back in Centerville, working as a farm hand.

    <div class="row">
      <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-7 summary-text">Hopkins took a second shot at Houston in 1946. While singing on Dowling
        Street in
        Houston's Third Ward, which would become his home base, he was discovered by Lola Anne Cullum of Aladdin
        Records, based in Los Angeles. She convinced Hopkins to travel to Los Angeles, where he accompanied the
        pianist Wilson Smith. The duo recorded twelve tracks in their first sessions in 1946. An Aladdin executive
        decided the pair needed more dynamism in their names and dubbed Hopkins "Lightnin'" and Wilson
        "Thunder".<br><br>
        Hopkins recorded more sides for Aladdin in 1947. He returned to Houston and began recording for Gold Star
        Records. In the late 1940s and 1950s he rarely performed outside Texas, only occasionally traveling to the
        Midwest and the East for recording sessions and concert appearances. It has been estimated that he recorded
        between eight hundred and a thousand songs in his career. He performed regularly at nightclubs
        in and around Houston, particularly on Dowling Street, where he had been discovered by Aladdin. He recorded the
        hit records "T-Model Blues" and "Tim Moore's Farm" at SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston. By the mid- to
        late 1950s, his prodigious output of high-quality recordings had gained him a following among African Americans
        and blues aficionados.

    <p class="summary-text">
      In 1959, the blues researcher Robert "Mack" McCormick contacted Hopkins, hoping to bring him to the attention of a
      broader musical audience engaged in the folk revival. McCormack presented Hopkins to integrated audiences first
      in Houston and then in California. He made his debut at Carnegie Hall on October 14, 1960, alongside Joan Baez and
      Pete Seeger, performing the spiritual "Mary Don't You Weep". In 1960, he signed with Tradition Records. The
      recordings which followed included his song "Mojo Hand" in 1960.<br><br>
      In 1968, Hopkins recorded the album Free Form Patterns, backed by the rhythm section of the psychedelic rock band
      13th Floor Elevators. Through the 1960s and into the 1970s, he released one or sometimes two albums a year and
      toured, playing at major folk music festivals and at folk clubs and on college campuses in the U.S. and
      internationally. He toured extensively in the United States and played a six-city tour of Japan in 1978.<br><br>
      Hopkins was Houston's poet-in-residence for 35 years. He recorded more albums than any other blues musician. A
      statue of Hopkins sits in Crockett, Texas.<br><br>
      Hopkins died of esophageal cancer in Houston on January 30, 1982, at the age of 69. His obituary in the New York
      Times described him as "one of the great country blues singers and perhaps the greatest single influence on rock
      guitar players.<br><br>
      His Gibson J-160e "hollowbox" is on display at the Rock Hall of Fame in Cleveland, and his Guild Starfire at the
      National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC, both on loan from the Joe Kessler
      collection.

    <h2 class="pt-2">Musical Style</h2>

      <p class="col-lg-9 summary-text">
        Hopkins's style was born from spending many hours playing informally without a backing band. His distinctive
        fingerstyle technique often included playing, in effect, bass, rhythm, lead, and percussion at the same
        time. He played both "alternating" and "monotonic" bass styles incorporating imaginative, often
        chromatic turnarounds and single-note lead lines. Tapping or slapping the body of his guitar added rhythmic
        accompaniment.<br><br>
        Much of Hopkins's music follows the standard 12-bar blues template, but his phrasing was free and loose. Many of
        his songs were in the talking blues style, but he was a powerful and confident singer.
        Lyrically, his songs expressed the problems of life in the segregated South, bad luck in love and other subjects
        common in the blues idiom. He dealt with these subjects with humor and good nature. He often referred to himself
        as "Poor Lightnin'" in his songs when talking about himself or referring to himself as the protagonist of the
        song. This is also the name of one of his albums. Many of his songs are filled with double entendres, and he was
        known for his humorous introductions to songs.<br><br><br>
        Some of his songs were of warning and sour prediction, such as "Fast Life Woman":<br><br>

        <i>You may see a fast life woman sittin' round a whiskey joint,<br>
          Yes, you know, she'll be sittin' there smilin',<br>
          'Cause she knows some man gonna buy her half a pint,<br>
          Take it easy, fast life woman, 'cause you ain't gon' live always...</i>
