    <h2 class="pt-3">The Idea</h2>
    <p class="summary-text">
        It has been a long time since I practiced creating something, and I'm pretty sure it shows by how this
        particular website
        looks. I needed to put my rusty skills to the test and decided that if I was to create something, it'd be about
        something that i liked. And that something was The Blues. I would create a website about something i like and
        learn more along the way. Thus began the creation of <i>"The Blues Archives"</i>
    </p>

    <h2 class="pt-3">The Process of Creation</h2>
    <p class="summary-text">
        I'm trying to develop a habit of planning before actually opening my VS Code, so i drew a concept of how the
        pages would look like in a piece of paper. It's a simple, but effective way to put my ideas outised my head. It
        also helped me to have a rough idea of how the page had to be structured, like how many divs I'd have to make to
        accomodate the content.<br><br>
        With that "concept art" next to me, it was time to sit in front of the PC and get things done. It's not exactly
        my very first time messing with this stuff so i already had a general idea on how to make a header and stuff. I
        still have no experience messing with JavaScript yet, so I sticked to what I know for this little project of
        mine. Creating this helped me a lot in improving my knowlege of Bootstrap, specially how the grid system works.
        I also don't know if I'm doing things considered bad practices, but I'll figure them out eventually.<br><br>
        After creating the homepage and the first artist page, the one talking about Lightnin Hopkins, things went
        pretty smoothly. The hardest step is first one, as some people say. Figuring out how to put an image next to a
        paragraph got me at first, but one day later, the idea came to put the paragraph and the image in the same row.
        After that, the only real problem was to make the page look responsiv and pretty in all screen sizes. I'm still
        not satisfied, but I'll take this project as a lesson and try to do better in the next projects.

    <h2 class="pt-3">Some Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="pb-3 summary-text">
        This is my first litte project after over a year of doing nothing, really. It feels good to be back, writing
        these lines and creating something that I enjoyed. It really is something else when you learn with something you
        like. I already have an idea of what to do next, and it is something related to music again. This time around
        I'll try to implement some JavaScript in it, to take myself to the next level. If someone other than myself is
        reading this, hello, I hope you are doing fine, and that you are at peace with yourself and your loved ones. All
        the best to you and your family.<br><br>
